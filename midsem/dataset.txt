DL:In recent years, researchers, for computer vision, have proposed many deep learning (DL) methods for various tasks, and facial recognition (FR) made an enormous leap using these techniques.
DL:Deep FR systems benefit from the hierarchical architecture of the deep learning methods to learn discriminative face representation.
CV:Computer vision methods have been widely used for facial recognition
