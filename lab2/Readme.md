## Q3
### `BFS` vs `A*` search
Both Greedy BFS and A* are Best first searches but Greedy BFS is neither complete, nor optimal whereas A* is both complete and optimal. However, A* uses more memory than Greedy BFS, but it guarantees that the path found is optimal. BFS is not complete while A* is complete. BFS Time complexity - O(b^m), (in worst case) but a good heuristic can give dramatic improvement (m is max depth of search space). A* star time complexity also depends a lot on the heuristic being used; otherwise with a poor heuristic it is exponential. 

A heuristic h(n) is admissible if  for every node n,
`h(n) â‰¤ h*(n)`, where `h*(n)` is the true cost to reach the goal 
state from n.

Since in the given problem admissible heursitics have been chosen the A* search is optimal with similar execution time as compared to BFS which makes it better in the given case.

### Test Case:

Start State:
|   |   |   |
| - | - | - |
| T8 | T7| T6|
| T1 | B | T5| 
| T2 | T3| T4|

Goal State:
|   |   |   |
| - | - | - |
| T1 | T2| T3|
| T8 | B | T4| 
| T7 | T6| T5|

### Result: 

| Algorithm | Heuristic | Optimal Path Cost | Time Taken | States Explored | Optimal| 
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| BFS | Zero heuristic | 28 | 25.3924 | 181273 | Fluke |
| BFS | Tiles Displaced | 50 | 0.09780 | 961 | No |
| BFS | Manhattan | 44 | 0.02950 | 332 | No |
| A* | Zero heuristic | 28 | 25.4986 | 181273 | Yes |
| A* | Tiles Displaced | 28 | 11.3247 | 108984 | Yes |
| A* | Manhattan | 28 | 2.91534 | 27227 | Yes |


## Instructions to run the code

1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` after creating a `conda` environment.

2. Enter the initial state and goal state in `/input/start_state.txt` and `/input/end_state.txt`.

3. Run:
```
python eight_puzzle.py input/start_state.txt input/end_state.txt 
```
